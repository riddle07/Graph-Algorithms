DSU was something I wanted to learn since I was a child. But as a child I had other thing to do. So I grew up apparently.

DSU(Disjoint Set Union) is basically a data structure with various use cases, most of which I am still finding out and will keep listing down below:

1. Check for cycle in the graph
2. Number of cycles in the graph
3. Number of Components in the graph

The structure of this data structure is in some sort like a tree. We just maintain a parent for each joint disjoint set.

Algorithm

1. For n nodes we will initially have n disjoint sets.
2. As we get an edge, we will check for the parent element of the nodes, if they are supposedly different we will union them.

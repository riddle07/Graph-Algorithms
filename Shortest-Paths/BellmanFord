Bellman Ford algorithm mostly come handy when we have to find the shortest path from source to target and the weights given are negative.

We can obviously use these for positive weights as well but in that case we have dijkstra algorithm which gives us result in O((V+E)log(v)) compared to bellmanfor's O((V+E)V)

// any guesses for why loop runs for n-1 times?? Well the node in a graph having n nodes in total can atmost have n-1 edges now in this algorithm if a node have k nodes then shortest path is guaranteed to be found out after k operations, hence the max iterations are n-1
